I'm Quentin Kaiser, a (now ex-)senior penetration tester turned independent security researcher.

I'm currently focusing on binary exploitation of embedded devices, hunting zero days in security software, and traditional bug bounty hunting.

You can get in touch by email ([contact@quentinkaiser.be](mailto:contact@quentinkaiser.be)) or Twitter ([@QKaiser](https://twitter.com/qkaiser)).

If you'd like to hire me, I provide security consulting services in the area of penetration testing, ethical hacking, vulnerability assessments and security code and configuration reviews with [Konkrete Security](https://konkretesec.com), a company I launched in 2021.
